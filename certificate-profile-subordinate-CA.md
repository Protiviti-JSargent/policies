The certificate artifacts served by the HTTP accessible location shall be a single DER encoded certificate as specified in [RFC2585] or a collection of certificates in a BER or DER encoded "certs-only" CMS message as specified in [RFC2797]. This extension is required to assist in monitoring and discovery of, and promote transparency for, the Subordinate/Issuing CAs. |

| Subject Key Identifier   | Mandatory | False |  Octet String <br> Derived using SHA-1 hash of the public key  |
| Key Usage   | Mandatory | True | keyCertSign, crlSign, digitalSignature and / or non-repudiation if the CA uses its key to sign OCSP responses   |
